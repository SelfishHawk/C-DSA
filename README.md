# C-DSA Repository

Welcome to my **C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! üëã  
This repo contains well-organized, topic-wise C++ programs that I've been working on during my **2nd semester** to master core concepts of programming and problem-solving.

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure

| Folder Name         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `Basic`            | Beginner-level C++ programs, basic syntax, and simple logic building. |
| `Binary Search Tree` | Programs for BST operations like insertion, deletion, search, flattening, merging, and more. |
| `Linked_list.cpp`   | Code to merge two sorted linked lists. |
| `OOPs`             | Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in C++, including copy constructors and operators. |
| `Queue`            | Circular queue implementation using arrays. |
| `Sorting`          | Sorting algorithm implementations and practice. |
| `Stack`            | Stack-based problems like checking balanced parentheses and transformations. |
| `Tree`             | General binary tree problems like longest path sum, top view, etc. |
| `.vscode`          | VS Code configuration and related files. *(not related to code logic)* |

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Included?

- üî¢ C++ implementations of core DSA topics
- üì¶ Clean folder-wise structure
- üö´ `.exe` files removed and ignored via `.gitignore`
- üìÑ Descriptive file naming
- üöß Continuously being updated as I learn more

## üìå Why this repo?

This is my learning space ‚Äî but I've made it public so:
- I can track my progress üìà
- Others can use these programs for learning üîç
- Interview prep becomes easier with organized practice üíº

## üß† Topics Covered

- C++ Basics & Syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Binary Search Trees

- Binary Tree Views, Paths, and Conversions

---

## üìö Future Plans

- Add README to each topic folder
- Add complexity analysis for each program
- Add comments for beginners
- Build small projects using DSA knowledge
